This project aims to develop a deep learning-based system for detecting and classifying brain tumors from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. The system utilizes convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to analyze MRI images and identify tumor presence, type, and location.

Methodology:

1. Data Collection: Gather MRI scans of brain tumors from various sources (e.g., hospitals, research institutions)
2. Data Preprocessing: Clean, resize, and normalize MRI images for training
3. Model Development: Train a CNN to detect and classify brain tumors into types (e.g., glioma, meningioma, pituitary adenoma)
4. Model Evaluation: Validate model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
5. Deployment: Integrate the model into a user-friendly interface for radiologists and clinicians

Key Features:

1. Tumor Detection: Identify tumor presence with high accuracy
2. Tumor Classification: Classify tumors into specific types
3. Tumor Segmentation: Segment tumors from surrounding brain tissue
4. Location Identification: Identify tumor location within the brain

Deep Learning Techniques:

1. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): For image analysis and feature extraction
2. Transfer Learning: Utilize pre-trained models for improved performance
3. Data Augmentation: Enhance training data through random transformations
